# FE9 Combat Display

Program that displays the combat information for Fire Emblem Path of Radiance.

Works by reading combat infromation from Dolphin's memory.

Currently only works for the JP version. Also haven't tested many differrent builds of Dolphin. Dolphin 5 should work.

I haven't been able to find the Might values, so it only displays Hit and Crit.

Works with animations on or off.
